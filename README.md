look, we're supposed to make like some kind of recipes
webpage or website, but i don't really know what is about, i don't even know fuckin github works, but anyway. 

i have to use some habilities that i already know so this isn't a real challenge, but i have to go thught this so i can get to the javascript course.

i think i'm about to use like, ordered and unordered lists, tag elements like img, html and shit. also the a tag, this one is really cool because i didn't knew how to use relative links o to organize my web files directory, so that's cool.

to be honest i just want to go over this one but it's really cool to learn at least som new stuff.
